# AI-Driven Linux Resource Management Distribution (BlueMesh)

## Overview

Welcome to the AI-Driven Linux Resource Management Distribution (AI-LRMD), a cutting-edge Linux distribution under development that leverages artificial intelligence to optimize and manage system resources dynamically. This distribution is designed to maximize performance and efficiency by intelligently monitoring CPU usage, classifying applications based on their resource needs, and automating resource management tasks.

AI-LRMD is based on the Linux From Scratch (LFS) tutorial, ensuring a robust and customizable foundation. Our goal is to create a system that not only performs well but also adapts to the needs of its users through intelligent automation.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Resource Management**: Advanced AI scripts monitor CPU performance and manage application resources based on real-time data.
- **Dynamic Application Classification**: Applications are classified according to their resource requirements, optimizing CPU and memory usage.
- **Automated Process Management**: Non-essential or resource-intensive processes are terminated automatically to maintain system performance.
- **Customizable Scripts**: Users can modify and extend AI scripts to fit specific needs and preferences.
- **LFS-Based Foundation**: Built on the Linux From Scratch tutorial, ensuring a solid and customizable base.

## Installation

Currently, AI-LRMD is in development, and installation instructions will be provided once the distribution reaches a more stable release. In the meantime, developers and testers can build the distribution using the Linux From Scratch (LFS) tutorial as a guide. Here's a general outline of the installation process:

1. **Build the Base System**:

   - Follow the [LFS Book](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/) to create a base Linux system.
   - Customize the base system according to your needs.

2. **Integrate AI Scripts**:

   - Download the AI scripts from our repository once they are available.
   - Follow the provided instructions to integrate and configure the AI scripts into your LFS-based system.

3. **Customize Resource Management**:
   - Edit and adjust AI scripts to better fit your system's needs and preferences.
   - Test and verify the resource management features to ensure they perform as expected.

## Customization

Customizing AI-LRMD involves modifying the AI scripts and system configurations to align with your specific needs. Here are some key areas to focus on:

1. **AI Scripts**:

   - Locate the AI scripts in the `/usr/local/bin/ai-scripts/` directory.
   - Modify the scripts to adjust thresholds, classifications, and process management rules.
   - Test changes to ensure they do not adversely affect system stability or performance.

2. **Configuration Files**:

   - Access configuration files in `/etc/ai-lrmd/`.
   - Update configuration settings to fine-tune how resources are managed and monitored.

3. **Performance Tuning**:

   - Adjust system performance parameters in `/etc/sysctl.conf` and other relevant files.
   - Use performance monitoring tools to analyze and refine system performance.

4. **Development and Testing**:
   - Contribute to the development of new features and improvements.
   - Test AI scripts and resource management functionalities thoroughly before deploying them on production systems.
